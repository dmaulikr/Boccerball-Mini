Boccerball-Mini
===============

An iOS game based off of "Boccerball" implemented in Cocos2d

This is an old project of mine that I decided to open source. It contains good examples of cocos2d/box2d, especially
filtering. It also has basic AI

Note that this project is old -- no ARC, runs on Cocos2d 1. It is also not iphone-5 optimized.
